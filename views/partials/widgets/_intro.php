    This screen shows a list of all your available widget layouts.

  <p>
    To add a new widget to a post or page, pick a widget layout, copy the shortcode, and paste it where you want the widget to appear.
  </p>
  <p>
    Initially the widget will contain popular Amazon products from the some default categories (books, electronics, and DVDs & Blu-Rays), but soon after you implement a new widget, the ProductWidgets algorithm will analyze the page that contains the widget and pick Amazon products that match your content better.
