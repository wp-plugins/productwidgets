<h3>
  Hi and welcome to ProductWidgets!
</h3>
<p>
  Unfortunately, there is a tiny problem we need to solve before we can get going.
</p>
<p>
  This plugin needs to be able to communicate with the ProductWidgets API (http://api.productwidgets.com).
  <br>
  Currently this is not possible because your hosting provider seems to block outgoing communication.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>
    Please contact your hosting provider and ask him kindly to unblock outgoing communication to http://api.productwidgets.com
    <br>
    The error that occurred was
    "<?php echo $api_error ?>"
  </strong>
</p>
<p>
  Please return to this screen once this problem is fixed.
  <br>
  Apologies for the inconvenience!
</p>
