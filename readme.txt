The Smart Alternative to Banner Ads - Monetise your website by promoting relevant products to your visitors.

== Description ==

**Whether you run a personal blog or topic website, ProductWidgets helps you to monetise your content without annoying your users. Our beautiful widgets automatically display products which are relevant to your content - they are a better-looking, better-performing, less-obtrusive and more flexible alternative to traditional ad banners.**

You can either set specific keywords for your widgets, and they will display products related to those keywords, or let the ProductWidgets analyze the pages you add widgets to, and find the best products for those pages automatically! The whole process is fully automated and happens behind the scenes, so you can focus on creating great content and let ProductWidgets take care of the monetization for you!

#### Millions of Products

ProductWidgets is backed by a database containing millions of products from niches such as fashion, technology, music, movies, gaming, sports, and health, and new products are added every day!

#### Fully Automated

Products are selected automatically based on keywords you define or the content of your website. Also, each widget's products are rotated regularly so returning visitors see fresh products every time.

#### Self-optimizing

Each product impression, click and sale is tracked and that data is used to make sure your widgets always display the best-performing products. Products that don't perform well are replaced automatically.

#### Geo-targeted

Displaying products to visitors that cannot possibly buy them from their country is a wasted opportunity! Our widgets know where each visitor is located and always display products from local advertisers.

#### Responsive

Your site is reponsive and looks good on phones and tablets? So should your widgets! It's easy to configure them to shrink or disappear on smaller screen sizes, while taking advantage of all available space on desktops.

#### Simple Implementation

Adding a widget to your website is easy and only takes a minute - simply use our Wordpress plugin or insert just one line of Javascript by hand. More plugins to other popular publishing platforms are coming soon!

== Installation ==

#### Attention please! We are currently only looking for publishers [from a selected list of (mostly European) countries](https://www.productwidgets.com/get-started/). More specifically, we cannot work together with publishers from the US yet. Unfortunately we had to limit the list of countries to be able to find great advertisers for all our publishers. We will definitely support publishers from the US and more countries soon!

#### Install the plugin directly from WordPress or manually

**Installation from WordPress:** Search for `ProductWidgets` on the plugins page of your WordPress backend.

**Manual installation:** Extract the zip file and copy the extracted folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.

#### Activate plugin

Activate the plugin from the plugins page of your WordPress backend.

#### Sign up

Click on the new "ProductWidgets" menu item to get to the signup form. Fill in the form and make sure to enter a correct email address. We will review your signup and activate your account shortly thereafter. You will receive an activation mail to the email address you entered with further information on how to get started.

#### Create your first widget

Once you receive the activation mail, you are all set to implement your first widget!

Log back in to your WordPress backend and click on the ProductWidgets menu item again. This will bring you to your list of widgets, which is of course empty until now. Click on the "Add New" link next to the headline or the "Add Widget" menu item to get to the screen that lets you create a new widget.

On this screen you can select a widget layout and decide whether you want to set the keywords for your new widget yourself or let ProductWidgets take care of selecting products for your widget. [Read more about this here!](https://www.productwidgets.com/how-it-works/#automation)

Once you click "Preview and get code", two more things will appear: the "widget shortcode" and a preview of your widget. You can test different layouts or keywords until you are satisfied with the widget, and then click on the widget shortcode to copy it.

Note that if you don't set your own keywords, the products in the preview widget will simply be popular products from our database. Once you add this widget to your website, the ProductWidgets algorithm will analyze your page and improve the product selection to fit your content.

You can now add the widget shortcode to a blog post, a page, the layout or even a sidebar widget (add a WordPress "text" widget to the sidebar and enter the shortcode there).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will the widgets slow down my website? =

We have taken care to build the widgets completely asynchronous, which means that most of the data (product data, images etc.) will be loaded only after your website has finished loading. Moreover, the widgets are stored on a global content delivery network (CDN), which makes them very fast, no matter from which country they are loaded.
This is to say that we have taken great care to make the widgets as fast and performant as possible, and there shouldn't be any noticeable slowdown of your website.

= What happens when the ProductWidgets website/service is down/unavailable? Will my widgets still appear? =

Yes! As mentioned in the previous question, the widgets are stored on a global content delivery network (CDN), which caches the widgets and delivers them very fast anywhere in the world, even if the ProductWidgets service is temporarily not available.
