The Smart Alternative to Banner Ads - Monetise your website by promoting relevant products to your visitors.

== Description ==

**The ProductWidgets plugin automates your affiliate marketing process by analyzing your content and displaying matching affiliate products to your visitors. The whole process is fully automated and happens behind the scenes, so you can focus on creating great content and let ProductWidgets take care of the monetization for you!**

Getting started is simple: install the plugin, place a widget shortcode in a posts or the sidebar, and products will be displayed immediately. Please note that it might take up to a three hours until the products are optimized for your content.

#### Fully automated

ProductWidgets is a "set and forget" solution and doesn't require any ongoing work after the initial setup. The magic happens behind the scenes where our algorithms are hard at work to make sure the widgets are always up to date and show the best products for your content.

#### Self-optimizing

Each widget selects its products automatically based on the content of the page it is implemented on. It then monitors the products it shows to make sure that the those that perform best are shown more often and those that don't receive a lot of clicks are sorted out quickly. This makes attractive products "bubble up" naturally and maximizes your commissions.

#### Always up-to-date

New products are added every day and old products are removed or go out of stock. ProductWidgets constantly checks whether all products are still available and automatically adds new ones to your widgets to see if they perform well.

#### Geo-targeted

Your visitors come from all over the world, and showing products from the US to a visitor from Italy would not be very smart. Products for your content are available in many different countries, and ProductsWidgets makes sure that your visitors always see products from their local shops.

#### Simple integration

Adding a widget to your site couldn't be easier: just install the plugin, pick from a standard widget layout (Leaderboard, Skyscraper etc.) and copy the shortcode to a post of the layout of your blog. Your widget will appear immediately and be optimized during the next few hours.

#### Unobtrusive

We understand you don't want ugly Flash widgets on your blog that are heavily branded and destroy your site layout! Our widgets are plain and simple and blend in to your site layout easily. We put the product images front and center since they receive the most clicks.

#### Fast

Our widgets are fast! On average, they load in less than 100 milliseconds and use asynchronous loading techniques to not slow down your site.

== Installation ==

= Install the plugin directly from Wordpress or manually =

**Manual installation:** Extract the zip file and copy the extracted folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.

= Activate plugin =

Activate the plugin from the plugins page of your Wordpress admin.

= Enter your affiliate IDs =

Note: this step can be skipped if you just want to test out the widgets on your page. You can always enter your affiliate IDs later.

To make sure that you receive the commissions for the products you promote, you need to enter your affiliate IDs in the plugin settings.

Open the ProductWidgets settings page (ProductWidgets > Settings) and enter your Amazon affiliate tracking IDs. The Amazon stores in each of the supported countries (UK, US, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, and Italy) each have a separate affiliate program, so you need to sign up to each program individually. The links to the programs are included on the settings page and signing up normally takes only a few minutes.

= Create your first widget =

Now you are all set to implement your first widget!

Go to the list of widget layouts (ProductWidgets > Widget Layouts) and pick the one you want to implement. (hint: to see a preview of how the widget will look like, click on "Preview"). Copy the shortcode of the widget layout and paste it where you want the widget to appear.

Note that you can add the shortcode to a blog post, a page, the layout or even a sidebar widget (for the latter, add a Wordpress "text" widget to the sidebar and enter the shortcode there).
